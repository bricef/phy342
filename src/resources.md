A great electronics course much like our own can be found at [doctronics](http://www.doctronics.co.uk/design.htm) they also cover [introductory digital electornics](http://www.doctronics.co.uk/DDE/DDE_contents.html). If our approach isn't for you for any reason, they're a great resource to use instead!

Doctronic also have a great [Beastie Zone](http://www.doctronics.co.uk/beastie_zone.htm) where you can find tons of info on various electronic components.

Find any datasheet: [alldatasheet.com](http://www.alldatasheet.com)

Those of you willing to dig deeper into electronics wizardry could do worse than subscribing to [Hackaday](http://hackaday.com/). You'll see what some electronics wizards get up to in their spare time, and hopefully, you'll be inspired to contribute yourself! They also have an incredibly useful Q&A site where you can ask electronics question. Make sure that your questions are as precise as possible to get fast and useful answers.

You could also have alook through the [Make Magazine](http://www.makezine.com/) electronics archives [here](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/electronics/) for inspiration and tips.

[Electrical What?!](http://electricalwhat.com/) is an online database of components. The innovative thing is that they allow you to search by component diagram appearance. That way, if you find a strange circuit diagram that you can't quite decipher, then you can use Electrical What?! to find what it is.

###*Make: Electronics*
 Make Magazine's [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Make-Electronics-Learning-Through-Discovery/dp/0596153740/) on electronics is excellent, and they have written a stellar introduction to electronics. We could not recommend it enough. It takes a modular approach and builds from scratch. 

###123  Robotics Experiments For the Evil Genius
The Quirky [123  Robotics Experiments For the Evil Genius](http://www.amazon.co.uk/123-Robotics-Experiments-Evil-Genius/dp/0071413588) is a great anf fun introduction to electronics. It goes through a number of great projects, and teaches about electronics along the way. A great place to begin.

###Practical Electronics for Inventors
 Paul Scherz's [Practical Electronics for Inventors](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Practical-Electronics-Inventors-Paul-Scherz/dp/0071452818) is an excellent electronics book, and will cover all thge required theory for quite a lot of electronics projects. This is not a tutorial, however, and is better suited for learning about components and their functions and as a reference. The physics primer is excellent, and every component is well explained. Scherz's water analogies are illuminating and well illustrated, and we have used them in our course. **We Highly recommend it**. Beware, however, that there are many typos, so if you find something going wrong, don't be scared to look into the errata online ([pdf](http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/physics/ph235/errata.pdf)).

###The Art of Electronics
Paul Horowitz's [The Art of Electronics](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Electronics-Paul-Horowitz/dp/0521370957/) is a very comprehensive electronics book, and covers each topic in depth. This is not a Beginner's book, but once you have advanced in your experience, it will become a great reference.

Going Digital
=============
As an introduction to the world of microcontroller, getting an [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) is a great place to start. The possibilities for what you could do are endless! You'll have to learn the fundamentals of programming to get the most out of your Arduino, but the effort will be well worth the investment.
