#Diodes

Diodes are electronic component with two terminals, that conduct electricity in one
direction only. It allows current to flow without any considerable resistance if the right terminal
is connected (forward direction), and completely blocks the current if the direction of current is reversed (reverse direction).

Diodes has two thresholds. The first one has to be reached to make diode conduct (usualy very small, in region of 0.7V), If this voltage is not present, diode acts like insulator. The second threshold can be reached if a very large voltage is applied in reverse direction, which breaks the diode and makes it conduct.
