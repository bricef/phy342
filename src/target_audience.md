Who is this course for?
=======================

This course is for anyone interested in advancing their electronics skill. That said, we make a few assumptions about the skills you already possess. 

**Electronics:** None at all! 

**Math:** Algebra is vital for a lot of the examples and is a requirement for designing circuits. However, the circuit examples are math free, so if you just want to get soldering, the instructions are enough. If you want to build an understanding of the concept behind the circuits, High school level math is a must, and knowledge of differentiation and integration will make it much easier to understand, but is not required.
